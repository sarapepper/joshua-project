					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>
					Getting Christians across the world involved with missions through YWAM in order to know God and to make Him known.
					</p>

					<h3>The Design Question</h3>
					<p>
					How can YWAM's website better reach Christians so more people can go out to learn and serve?
					</p>

					<h3>Ultimate Impact</h3>
					<p>
					Engaging every Christian in missions by getting them involved with YWAM's outreach trips and Discipleship Training Schools
					</p>

					<h3>Possible Solutions to Problem</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Organization of the menu</li>
							<li>A clear call-to-action on the homepage</li>
							<li>Consistent branding</li>
							<li>More negative space</li>
							<li>High quality images that represent the brand</li>
							<li>Clearer search layout for outreach trips</li>
							<li>Clear and concise copy-writing</li>
							<li>Make the design more youthful</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Context and Constraints</h3>
					<p>
					The website needs to reach people from different cultures that speak different languages but also, reach YWAM's primary focus of youth while still engaging ages younger and older. The information on the re-designed site will need to be organized  in a clear and concise way, as well.
					</p>

					<h3>The Design Question Revised</h3>
					<p>
					How can YWAM's re-designed website engage more Christians from all ages and cultures to be involved in missions to know God through the Discipleship Training Schools and to make Him known through the Outreach Trips?
