					<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
					<h3>Research from the YWAM Website</h3>
					<p>Youth with a Mission, better known as YWAM (“WHY-wham”), strives to know God and make Him known throughout the world. Through this goal, YWAM specifically focuses on getting youth involved with missions through evangelism, serving, and discipleship, and with over 1200 ministry centers and Discipleship Training Schools, they are able to make that possible.</p>

					<h4>Home Page</h4>
					<p>
						YWAM’s home page features various sections to learn more about their Discipleship Training Schools, ways to get involved, and a map to explore trips. The page also features a video that summarizes what YWAM is as well as a section highlighting the latest news updates.
					</p>

					<h4>DTS and Training</h4>
					<p>
					The Discipleship Training School (DTS) is highlighted throughout YWAM’s site and seems to be one of their greatest draws along with their outreach trips. It gives people the opportunity for intense discipleship accompanied by an opportunity for outreach.
					<br></br>
					They also have the University of the Nations which has locations across the world. In order to complete other classes at this university, students are required to go through DTS as a prerequisite. People can choose a variety of studies from their seven different colleges within the University.
					<br></br>
					Their mission of knowing God is seen through the training and schooling they offer and then the ministry centers across the world display how YWAM makes God known.
					</p>

					<h4>Get Involved</h4>
					<p>
						YWAM’s core mission of making God known and knowing Him is clearly displayed through the variety of opportunities offered. One of the ways that people can get involved is through the option of outreach trips. Through the site, I was able to search different outreach trips based on interests or by location. The outreach trips range in length, location, and task. People are also able to volunteer if they are by a local ministry center or they can join staff and serve alongside other YWAMers. If people do not want to be involved with these opportunities directly, they can find resources on how to pray and donate to YWAM.
					</p>

					<h4>About Us</h4>
					<p>
						Under this section, there are ten tabs to choose from. Both <i>About YWAM</i> and <i>YWAM Purpose, Beliefs, Values</i> gives better insight to their core mission and beliefs that the organization stands by. Through this, I learned that YWAM invites all Chrisitans from every denomination around the globe to be a part of their organization, and because of this, almost half of their staff comes from Non-Western countries.
						<br></br>
						I also found a variety of opportunities for groups, parents, churches, children and teens, and alumni to explore. The trip opportunities showed me that even though their mission is targeted at younger adults, they have expanded to reach a broader audience.
						<br></br>
						Then, I came across the contact page that leads users to a FAQ and a search bar to look up specific YWAM ministry centers’ contact information. While there are still ways to contact the main office, the main purpose of the contact page seems to direct users to their desired ministry centers for more information.
					</p>

					<h3>Research from YWAM's Social Media</h3>
					<p>
					Because of the variety of ministry centers, there are a lot of social media accounts connected to the YWAM’s main account. Across social media platforms and the variety of accounts connected to YWAM, the majority of the time pictures show young adults whether on trips serving or in small groups. This can especially be seen on their Instagram and Twitter. Their Facebook also shares a lot of informative videos that feature different ministry centers and their stories.
					</p>

					<h3>Research from YWAM's News Stories</h3>
					<p>
					The most recent news story was for their Global Prayer Initiative that YWAM started promoting in September of 2020. Podcasts, videos, and reading all accompanied this initiative. A news story like this gave me insight to the smaller sides of the organization and how the story was promoted.
